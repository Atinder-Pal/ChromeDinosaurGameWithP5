# ChromeDinosaurGameWithP5

In this project, I tried to simulate Chrome's Dinosaur Game using P5.js Library by following this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0HoJHc-63Q).

Instead of Dinosaur and cacti- I will use unicon and train respectively.
Added feature in this practice is the use of ml5 libarary for speech Classifier which will recognize the use sound input and will make the unicorn jump when user says 'Up'.
